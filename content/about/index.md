### Who am I? What is my background?
I am an ambitious, organised, and self-motivated individual with a strong academic background in analytical research and Psychology, with an MSc in Developmental Psychology. I have a keen interest in Python and data analytics, am continuously building on my skills and learning by working on personal projects, such as co-managing a recipe website through VS Code and GitHub, playing around with APIs to create simple games, as well as taking part in Data Analysis courses to further my knowledge.

### Why am I interested in a career in data? 
I have always been quite an organised individual, with an interest in data manipulation and descriptive statistics - these were some the reasons why I decided to study Psychology at University. I enjoyed finding trends and patterns within data. 

<!-- ### What industry interests me and why? -->

### What did I gain from taking part in Python / Data Analysis course?
#### Code First Girls - Introduction to Python and Apps
This online course was one of the first things I did to try and learn Python. It was an enjoyable course and helped to cement the basics in my mind, as well as showing me some of the more creative things you can do with Python (like creating a Top Trumps game). 

<!-- #### PyCon UK 2023 - Django Girls Workshop -->

#### Free Code Camp - Data Analysis with Python
Through this course I got my first proper taste of Python as a data analysis tool and learnt to use Jupyter notebooks as well as Google Colab. 

#### Cambridge Spark - L4 Data Analysis Bootcamp
Through the Data Analysis Bootcamp, I was able to developed further knowledge of Python softwares and libraries (such as Pandas and NumPy) as well as data visualisation tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh, and gain confidence in my programming skills, so as to be able to career switch and move into a Data Analysis role.

### How does data add value to organisations?
Through data analysis you are able to better understand your target market/client base and gain insight as to how to improve your business. It also allows you to identify trends and patterns so you can see what's going well and what isn't. As a result, it can also improve decision making backing up what you have done previously, leading to better informed decisions. 

### What can I contribute to a business? 
My contribution to a business would be my passion, curiosity, and work ethic. I strive to work to the best of my ability and am eager to learn where possible. I also have great attention to detail and enjoy a challenge.
