This assignment focused on datasets from the UK government, detailing energy consumption across various sectors of industry. This included Electricity, Natural
Gas, and Oil energy consumptions (measured in kwh).

Within this assignment I...

<!-- Before we were able to perform any data analysis, some data cleansing was required which was the focus of this project. What do I mean by data cleansing? That is the removal of missing or incorrect values, and superfluous data. Transforming some of the data involved changing data types which allowed me to utilise arithmetic operators to create new columns within the data set before analysis took place. -->

### Importing Libraries

To begin with, I first need to import some python libraries; **Pandas** and `Matplotlib` (or more specifically, pyplot):
```python
import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```
I also added the following code which sets the logging level to 'ERROR', meaning that only errors and critical messages will be logged and I won't receive debug, info, or warning log messages. 

```python
from matplotlib.axes._axes import _log as matplotlib_axes_logger
matplotlib_axes_logger.setLevel('ERROR')
```

### Data Collection

Using the following code, I was able to
