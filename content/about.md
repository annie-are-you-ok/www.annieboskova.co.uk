### Who am I? What is my background?

I am an ambitious, organised, and self-motivated individual with a strong academic background in analytical research and Psychology, with an MSc in Developmental Psychology. I have a keen interest in Python and data analytics, am continuously building on my skills and learning by working on personal projects, such as co-managing a recipe website through VS Code and GitHub, playing around with APIs to create simple games, as well as taking part in Data Analysis courses to further my knowledge.
